/* General note: this view takes two main forms, depending on whether the 
 * client was 'bundled' with the SeruroServer address and certificate.
 * (Manual) means the Client was installed without this bundle and is 
 * determined based on the existance of a "SeruroConfig.config" file.
 * (Auto) means the Client was bundled with a config file listing the 
 * address of the SeruroServer, and *should* have the server's TLS
 * certificate installed. 
 *
 * Problem(1): the manual install may try to connect to a server that uses
 * a CA-signed TLS cert, so the user does NOT have to provide the cert.
 * Problem(2): we bypass the 'manual' check if a config exists, it is 
 * very possible and likely that a user will write their own, but this
 * does not mean a TLS cert is provied (resulting in problem 1). However
 * the 'auto' install may fail, or the TLS cert may be removed by some
 * other means, turning an 'auto' install into something terrible for the
 * unknowning-user. A config without TLS cert error should be handled
 * gently to say the least.
 *
 * Handling: Knowning the odd-ities of having a TLS cert, this view
 * will initially NOT ask for a TLS cert for the manual case. If an
 * SSL/TLS handshake fails due to an unknown-server-cert, then the view
 * will change and ask the user for the cert. For the non-manual case
 * the view will display an ERROR, but allow the user to continue.
